# REU_GOALS

In this paper, I simulate data to mimic a situation in which the relationship between the response and the covariate depends on the individual, and positive and negative responses could cancel each other out. Assuming a Gaussian Process model, I fit it to the data and measure the independent variable's local and global importance using the "GlObal And Local Score" (GOALS) operator, which provides a way to assess local and global variable importance simultaneously in nonlinear models.
